Welcome aspiring spy, we challenge you to eye spy. A game where you must sneak through rooms of different color by matching you clothing to the color. However, you have a colour blindness so the color that appears is not the one that others will see you as. You must figure out what the wavelenght of the reflected light in each room is to disguise yourself, so when faced with your final challenge you can recognize which color blindess you have to defuse the bomb.
